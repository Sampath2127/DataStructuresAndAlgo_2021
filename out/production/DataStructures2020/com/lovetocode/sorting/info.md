Insertion Sort Worst (O(n^2)), Best (O(n)), Average (O(n^2))
- 
Is useful and faster when the elements are nearly sorted and smaller size.

Merge Sort W (O(n log n)), B (O(n)), A (O(n log n))
-
Follows divide and conquer approach. 

[6][5][3][1][8][7][2][4]
Divides the example array above into smaller subsets until one item is in each subset
[6] -- [5] -- [3] -- [1] -- [8] -- [7] -- [2] -- [4].
Then the elements will be merged back in pairs in reverse order and combine the sorted subsets.
